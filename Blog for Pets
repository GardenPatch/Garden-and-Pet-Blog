How to Recover a Lost Pet


Before
Prevention and planning can save you heartache later. Here's how:
Always make sure your pet wears a collar with an identification tag attached. It could include the name of your pet, your name, and your number.
Consider microchipping your pet. Microchipping involves a small rice sized implant that identifies both you and your pet and increases the chances of reuniting if they are ever lost or stolen.
Sign up for a lost pet rescue service* and/or download an app for this purpose. Usually, these services will hold a photo and description of your pet. Then, in the event of loss, they will broadcast it amongst their followers/members.
Understand your pet’s personality and plan accordingly. Are they likely to run out of the front door? Consider placing a dog gate there. Do they jump fences? Will they dart off to chase a small animal? Set up the appropriate methods of prevention.

After
Don't panic. Follow these steps:
Start looking for your pet immediately. Search the immediate area where your pet went missing as soon as you realize they are lost.
Alert your rescue membership service or app if applicable.
Contact your local shelters and police to let them know your pet is missing.
Place fliers of your lost pet and post them around your area or in the area they went missing
Get help from social media. You may be able to reach a wide audience this way (but it’s most helpful if viewers will be in the area).
According to the ASPCA, “Only 15 percent of pet guardians reported a lost dog or cat. [Of that amount] 93 percent of dogs and 75 percent of cats reported lost were returned safely to their homes.” This demonstrates the importance of reporting a lost pet.

*a great example of a rescue membership you may want to look in to is AKC Reunite.
